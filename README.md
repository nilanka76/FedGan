 Federated GAN Model for MRI Image Denoising in Privacy-Preserving Environment-

 Abstract: Medical Image Enhancement plays a crucial role in the analysis of the medical visual data. Image enhancement raises the visual quality of the image, aids the doctor in making a choice, and ultimately saves the lives of the patients. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for image enhancement in various domains, including medical imaging. However, the use of GANs in medical image enhancement raises concerns about data privacy and security. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution to address these concerns by enabling training of machine learning models on decentralized data sources without sharing the data. In this paper, we propose a federated GAN model for medical image enhancement in privacy-preserving environments. Our proposed model utilizes a federated learning approach to train a GAN model on Brain tumor MRI dataset. It can be used for enhancing medical images of Brain tumor MRI for various chest abnormalities and provides a promising approach for medical image enhancement in privacy- preserving environments, which can be useful for various medical applications, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning.
